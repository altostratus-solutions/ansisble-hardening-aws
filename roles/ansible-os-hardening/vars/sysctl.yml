  # net.core.somaxconn
  # source http://linux.die.net/man/2/listen
  # SOMAXCONN can be used as a statement which specifies the max number of connection requests 
  # that can be queued for any given listening socket.
  # If the backlog argument is greater than the value in /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn, then it is silently truncated to that value; 
  # the default value in this file is 128. In kernels before 2.4.25, this limit was a hard coded value, SOMAXCONN, with the value 128.
  # source https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/high_throughput.html
  # /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn: Limit of socket listen() backlog, known in userspace as SOMAXCONN. Defaults to 128. 
  # The value should be raised substantially to support bursts of request. 
  # For example, to support a burst of 1024 requests, set somaxconn to 1024.

  # The default value of 256 is increased to 1024 when the memory present in the system is adequate or greater (>= 128Mb), 
  # and reduced to 128 for those systems with very low memory (<= 32Mb).
  # It is recommended that if this needs to be increased above 1024, 
  # TCP_SYNQ_HSIZEin include/net/tcp.h be modified to keep TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE*16<=tcp_max_syn_backlog,and the kernel be recompiled.
